## Intro to JS

### JavaScript Data Types Overview
There are seven primitive data types in JavaScript:
  1. Symbol
  2. Undefined
  3. Null
  4. Boolean
  5. Number
  6. String
  7. BigInt (new as of ES2020)

In Javascript, everything that isn't a primitive data type is considered an object. Non-primitive data type: 
  1. Object  

Objects can be used to describe key value pairs much like Ruby. Javascript also extends the object to give functionality to things like arrays, functions, and other complex data types. Many have constructor functions and many use the literal values. Different data types are pass by reference and pass by value.

### Constructors versus Literals
```js
let anotherNum = 1
let someNum = Number(1)
let someNewNum = new Number(1)
someNewNum === anotherNum // => false
someNum === anotherNum // => true
```

### Primitives
Pass-by-value - when you declare a variable and pass it to a function, a *copy* of the variable is passed, not the original object in memory.

* String
  * `'I'm a string in single quotes'`
  * `"I'm a string in double quotes"`
  * `` `I'm a string template with backticks and interpolation ${'Yay!'}` ``

* Number
  * Negative `-1`
  * Exponent `-1e2`
  * Float `-1.1e2`
  * NaN `'hello' * 3`
  * parseInt / parseFloat

      ```js
      parseInt('123')             // => 123
      parseInt('123.456')         // => 123
      parseFloat('123.456')       // => 123.456
      parseInt('one two three')   // => NaN
      ```

* Boolean
  * Falsey values
    * False: `false`
    * Zero: `0`
    * Empty string: `""`
    * Null: `null`
    * Undefined: `undefined`
    * Not a number: `NaN`
  * Truthy values (everything else)

* Undefined
  * A variable that is declared but not assigned a value

    ```js
    let someVar
    console.log(someVar) // => undefined
    ```

* Null
  * An assignment value that represents nothing, like `nil` in Ruby

    ```js
    let someVar = null
    console.log(someVar) // => null
    ```

* Symbol
  * Only used as somewhat private, unique identifiers for object properties, i.e. object keys. (Don't worry much about these.)

    ```js
    let sym = Symbol()
    console.log(sym) // => Symbol()
    ```

### Non-Primitives
**Pass-by-reference**: when you declare a variable and pass it to a function, the object in memory itself is passed, not a copy of the object.

* Object
  * A loaded word in JavaScript. Basically everything that's not a primitive is an object. Objects describe key-value pairs, like hashes in Ruby. They also describe arrays, functions, prototypes, and other complex data types.

  * Object literals
    * Also known as plain-old JavaScript objects (POJOs), these are really simple key-value pairs. The keys are strings (or Symbols), and the values are any data type, including other objects.

      ```js
      const fred = { name: 'Fred', age: 26 }
      const jone = { name: 'Jone' }
      const school = {
        students: [fred, jone]
      }
      ```
    * You access properties of objects in one of two ways: dot-notation or bracket-notation. With the brackets, the value that is passed in needs to evaluate to a String or a Symbol.

      ```js
      const nameKey = 'name'
      console.log(`${fred.name} is ${fred.age}`) // => "Fred is 26"
      console.log(`My friend's name is ${jone[nameKey]}`) // => "My friend's name is Jone"
      ```
* Array
    * Arrays in JavaScript are similar to arrays in Ruby, but with different methods. Ruby has a robust enumerable library that can work on arrays and POJOs alike, but JavaScript is more DIY, so there are just enough enumerables to build what you need. Arrays can contain any data type.

    ```js
    let arr = [1, 2, 3, "a", "b", "c", { hello: 'world' }]
    arr.forEach(function(el) { console.log(el) }) // => prints 1, 2, 3, "a", "b", "c", { hello: 'world' }
    ```

* Function
  * Definition VS invocation. **THIS IS SUPER IMPORTANT**

```js
function iLikePancakes() {
  console.log('Pancake technology is truly incredible. What a time to be alive!')
}

iLikePancakes

// VS
iLikePancakes()
```

  * Another point to note is that _functions always return undefined unless explicitly returning otherwise_. **PLEASE BURN THIS INTO YOUR MEMORY**. There is only one case of implicit returns in JavaScript and that's with one-line arrow functions without braces (more on that later).

  * Functions are POJO's that can be executed/called! This means that you can add properties to functions just like you do POJO's:

```js
function functionsAreObjects() {
  return 'nice'
}

functionsAreObjects.name = 'a function object'
```

  * Function expression
    * This is like a function that can't live without being assigned to a variable, or a function that is defined right when it's used (as in as an argument to another function).

      ```js
      let arr = [1,2,3]
      let doSomething = function() { return true }
      let doSomethingElse = () => false
      arr.map(function namedExpression(n) { return n + 1 })
      ```

  * Function declaration
    * This is simply a variable assignment and a function expression mashed into one. It ALWAYS begins with the `function` keyword and needs a name.

      ```js
      function doSomething() {
        return true
      }

      console.log(doSomething) // f doSomething()
      ```

### Type Checking
The original way of checking types, [`typeof`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/typeof), is a little unreliable when looking at some objects like arrays, which return "object". This works best for primitive values. For example:

```js
parseInt('HOTDOG') //NaN

typeof parseInt('HOTDOG') //'number'

typeof NaN //'number'
```

## Documentation

- **PLEASE ALSO BURN THIS INTO YOUR MEMORY**. Always start with [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) when looking at JS documentation. W3 Schools is great for HTML and CSS, **NOT SO MUCH FOR JAVASCRIPT**.

(all hail Mozilla)

- **INDENTATION AND PROPER STYLE ARE ALSO SUPER IMPORTANT MOVING FORWARD**. Airbnb has an amazing [JavaScript Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) if you're unsure about how to format your JS code. Trust me, learn to indent properly now before you end up in a curly bracket hellscape.
