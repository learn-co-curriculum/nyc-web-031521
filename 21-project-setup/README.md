# React Project Setup

## Notes

- git/github
- json-server with associations
- json-server w fake login
- css

## Setup

For this project, you will need two separate repositories: one for your frontend
and one for your backend. This will make it easier to deploy your project later,
should you choose to do so.

### Frontend Setup

Use `create-react-app` to generate starter code for your your project. Follow
the instructions on this site to get started:
[create-react-app](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started)

### Backend Setup

Use
[this json-server template](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/json-server-template)
to generate your backend code. Using this template will make it easier to deploy
your backend later on.
